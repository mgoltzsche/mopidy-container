# Mopidy and Snapcast docker compose

This repo aims to provide an opinionated, containerized bundle of [Mopidy](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy) and [Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) that runs on both an amd64 linux machine and a Raspberry Pi.  

The Snapcast container image is maintained within a [separate repository](https://github.com/mgoltzsche/snapcast-container).  

Currently you have to build the container images yourself before you can use the docker compose file.
